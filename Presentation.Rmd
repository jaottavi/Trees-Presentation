```

## Summary
This analysis focuses on the relationship between trees:
- Girth
- Height
- Weight
Using the `trees` datset from the `datasets` package.

## Data
The data is split into three columns representing `girth`, `height`, and `volume` of the tree.
```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
head(trees)
```

## Interactive Plot
```{r plotly, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="The Graph", warning=FALSE}
require(plotly)
trees <- trees
plot_ly(trees, x = ~Girth, y = ~Height, color = ~Volume, type = "scatter",
        mode = "markers")
```
